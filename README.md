Tenkeyless Keyboard with 2 Port USB-Hub

So I wanted to build myself a mechanical keyboard after seeing tones of build-videos online. But since I know how to design electrical circuits and make them in to an PCB, I decided to create it fully from scratch.
I planned the PCB in KICad and build the Housing with Freecad. The Software on the keyboard is a costume QMK firmware that i programmed.
As extra added features I wanted a USB-Hub for my mouse dongle and to connect a USB-Stick on occasion. Also an encoder for volume-adjustment and RGB backlightning was added.

The USB-Hub a Microchip USB2513BI chip was used. It is a 3 Port USB2.0 Hub controller.
The keyboard controller is standard Microchip AT90USB646.

For the housing i used Freecad to design a housing that i could print on my 3D-printer and a plate that i got lasercut out of stainless steel by a spanish company.
After printing the housing I did an lot of sanding, filling, more sanding, primer and than a white spraypaint layer and matt clearcoat.
